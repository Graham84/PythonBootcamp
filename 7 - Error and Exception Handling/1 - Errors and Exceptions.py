# Errors and Exception HandlingÂ¶

In this lecture we will learn about Errors and Exception Handling
in Python. You've definitely already encountered errors by this
point in the course. For example:

print 'Hello

File "<ipython-input-1-23e01f0d17c8>", line 1
    print 'Hello
               ^
SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

Note how we get a SyntaxError, with the further description
that it was an EOL (End of Line Error) while scanning the
string literal.
This is specific enough for us to see that we forgot a single
quote at the end of the line.
Understanding these various error types will help you debug
your code much faster.
This type of error and description is known as an Exception.
Even if a statement or expression is syntactically correct,
it may cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it.
Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and
are not unconditionally fatal.
You can check out the full list of built-in exceptions here.
now lets learn how to handle errors and exceptions in our own
code.

# try and except
The basic terminology and syntax used to handle errors in
Python is the try and except statements.
The code which can cause an exception to occur is put in the
try block and the handling of the exception is the
implemented in the except block of code.
The syntax form is:

try:
   You do your operations here...
   ...
except ExceptionI:
   If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.
except ExceptionII:
   If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.
   ...
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block.

We can also just check for any exception with just using
except: To get a better understanding of all this lets
check out an example:
We will look at some code that opens and writes a file:

# finally
The finally: block of code will always be run regardless if
there was an exception in the try code block. The syntax is:

try:
   Code block here
   ...
   Due to any exception, this code may be skipped!
finally:
   This code block would always be executed.
