# zip
# zip() makes an iterator that aggregates elements from each
# of the iterables.

# Returns an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple
# contains the i-th element from each of the argument
# sequences or iterables. The iterator stops when the
# shortest input iterable is exhausted.
# With a single iterable argument, it returns an iterator
# of 1-tuples. With no arguments, it returns an empty
# iterator.

# zip() is equivalent to:
# def zip(*iterables):
#     # zip('ABCD', 'xy') --> Ax By
#     sentinel = object()
#     iterators = [iter(it) for it in iterables]
#     while iterators:
#         result = []
#         for it in iterators:
#             elem = next(it, sentinel)
#             if elem is sentinel:
#                 return
#             result.append(elem)
#         yield tuple(result)


# zip() should only be used with unequal length inputs
# when you donâ€™t care about trailing, unmatched values from
# the longer iterables.

# Lets see it in action in some examples:
# Examples

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [4, 5, 6]

# Zip the lists together
print zip(x, y)

# [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
# Note how tuples are returned.
# What if one iterable is longer than the other?

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Zip the lists together
print zip(x, y)

# [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
# Note how the zip is defined by the shortest iterable
# length. Its generally advised not to zip unequal length
# iterables unless your very sure you only need partial
# tuple pairings.

# What happens if we try to zip together dictionaries?
d1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
d2 = {'c': 4, 'd': 5}

print zip(d1, d2)

# [('a', 'c'), ('b', 'd')]
 #This makes sense because simply iterating through the
# dictionaries will result in just the keys.
# We would have to call methods to mix keys and values:

print zip(d2, d1.itervalues())

# [('c', 1), ('d', 2)]
# Great! Finally lets use zip a to switch the keys and
# values of the two dictionaries:


def switcharoo(d1, d2):
    dout = {}

    for d1key, d2val in zip(d1, d2.itervalues()):
        dout[d1key] = d2val

    return dout

print switcharoo(d1, d2)

# {'a': 4, 'b': 5}
# Great! You can use zip to save a lot of typing in many
# situations! You should now have a good understanding of
# zip() and some possible use cases.
