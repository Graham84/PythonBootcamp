Hints and Tips for Functions and Methods Assignment
Section 6, Lecture 44
Here are some hints for helping you complete the assignment!

1. Volume of a sphere

Write out your solution by hand as an equation with an input radius, then try to convert your logic to code.


2. Range check function

Keep in mind how to use the in operator and the range() function. How can you use in to check if something
is in a list?

3. Upper Case and Lower Case strings

Whats a goo way to iterate through the string? A for loop perhaps? How can you keep track of you counts?
A variable or maybe even a dictionary with a key for upper and a key for lower, then add counts to the
value corresponding to the correct key.
