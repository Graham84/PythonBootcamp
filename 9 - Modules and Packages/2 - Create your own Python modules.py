# Create your own Python modules.
# Section 11, Lecture 68
# A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.
# The file name is the module name with the suffix .py
#
# create hello.py then write the following function:
#
# def helloworld():
#
# print "hello"
#
# >>> import hello
#
# >>> hello.helloworld()
#
# 'hello'
#
# >>>
#
# To group many .py files put them in a folder.
# Any folder with an __init__.py is considered a module by python
# and you can call them a package
#
# |-HelloModule
#
# |_ __init__.py
